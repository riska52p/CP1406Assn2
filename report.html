<h2>Result of Usability & Accessibility Testing</h2>
<p>N = 5  
<br>Ø = 3/3 points</p>
<p><b>Issues:</b> 
<p>1 out of 5 persons claimed the website to be “too complicated”
<br><i>Possible explanation:</i> She was not able to find the order form straight away</p>

<p><b>Recommendations:</b>
<p>1 out of 5 persons found typography mistakes 
<br><i>Note: corrected immediately afterwards</i></p>

<p>1 out of 5 persons complained about the length of the product description 
<br><i>Note:</i> subjective taste, nonetheless we consider this critic</p>

<p>1 out of 5 persons recommends our “search function” 
<br><i>Note:</i> Search bar is one of the most difficult parts of the page and we tried our best</p>

<h2>PMI</h2>
<h3>Plus: </h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Each team member had her individual skill referring to web design and therefore work was done efficiently and very fast</li>
<li>Interest in topic was generally high and team members were very committed in learning more in spare time</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Minus:</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Some expectations were too high for level 1 students e.g. JavaScript (completely self-taught), searchbar function. Therefore very time consuming for programmers in group (other assignments were also important and  it was stressful)</li>
<li>GitHub was more an obstacle than a help as we experienced a lot of synching problems and conflicts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Interesting:</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>/</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Recommendations:</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>Knowing the term is sort we still strongly recommend to teach more skills during practicals especially those related to the assignments. JavaScript, Adobe PS and HTML/CSS were presented very briefly and superficially hence everyone had to teach herself through the internet which was time consuming and also frustrating (no exact solution available online, non -reliable resources, problems with functionality etc.)</li>
</ul>
</p>
